Welcome to my Machine Learning repository! This repo showcases a collection of ML projects that cover a variety of tasks, including classification, regression, and clustering. Each project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

Several projects also feature interactive Streamlit web apps, allowing users to explore the models in real-time via a web browser.

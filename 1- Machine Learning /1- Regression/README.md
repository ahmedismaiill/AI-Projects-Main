ðŸ“ˆ Regression Projects in Machine Learning
Welcome to my collection of Regression-based Machine Learning projects! This repository includes multiple projects focused on predicting continuous numerical values using a variety of regression algorithms. Each project demonstrates the full ML pipeline: data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, evaluation, and (in some cases) deployment via Streamlit apps.

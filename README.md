ðŸ¤– AI Projects: From EDA to Deep Learning
Welcome to my Artificial Intelligence (AI) Projects repository! This repo features end-to-end AI workflows, starting from data exploration and visualization, moving through traditional machine learning, and advancing into deep learning techniques.

Each project includes:

- Data loading and cleaning

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visual storytelling using plots

- Model training and evaluation

- Optional deployment (Streamlit or APIs)
